Smart Energy Consumption Forecasting and Anomaly Detection Using Time-Series Machine Learning Models

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting household electricity consumption and detecting abnormal energy usage patterns using time-series machine learning models. Accurate energy prediction can help optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and identify unusual consumption behavior that may indicate faults or inefficiencies.

The project uses historical smart meter data from a single household to build predictive and anomaly detection models.
